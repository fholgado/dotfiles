#My Vim dotfiles

Here you will find my collection of Vim configuration files. I am using Pathogen to keep things tidy. Here is a blog post with more details on what is in [here](http://fhl.gd/qw7u).

You can get in touch with me at [fholgado at gmail dot com](mailto:fholgado@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
